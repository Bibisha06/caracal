# Contributing to Caracal

Thank you for your interest in Caracal. This guide covers what you need to develop, test, and submit changes.

## Prerequisites

- Node 24+
- pnpm 10
- Docker Compose v2
- Go 1.26 (only required when changing Go services or shared Go packages)
- Python 3.11+ (only required when changing the Python MCP package)
- Bun (only required to build distributable CLI binaries via `bun build --compile`)

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Garudex-Labs/caracal.git
cd caracal
pnpm install
cp infra/docker/.env.example infra/docker/.env
pnpm caracal up
pnpm caracal init
```

`caracal up` builds and starts the full local stack (postgres, redis, init, sts, api, gateway, audit, coordinator). The API applies database migrations on boot. `caracal init` provisions the local zone via `POST /v1/local/bootstrap` and writes the resolved `caracal.toml` (an existing local file first, otherwise `~/.config/caracal/caracal.toml`) with a freshly generated client secret.

Use `pnpm caracal status` to probe `/health` on every service. Use `pnpm caracal down` to stop the stack, or `pnpm caracal down -v` to also wipe volumes.

## Repository Layout

- `apps/api` — admin / management plane (Fastify, TypeScript)
- `apps/cli` — `caracal` command (TypeScript, Node 24, optional Bun build)
- `services/sts`, `services/gateway`, `services/audit` — Go services
- `apps/agent-coordinator` — TypeScript coordinator with embedded Go relay
- `packages/shared` — shared Go libraries
- `packages/ts-shared` — shared TypeScript helpers (internal)
- `packages/caracalai-*` — public SDKs (TypeScript, Go, Python)
- `infra/docker` — Compose orchestration; `infra/postgres/migrations` — SQL migrations applied by the API at boot
- `tests/{typescript,go,python,shared}` — co-located test trees

Per-directory rules live in each directory's `instructions.md`. Read those before making changes inside a directory.

## Tests

Run the full suite:

```bash
pnpm test
```

Run a single layer:

```bash
pnpm run test:typescript
pnpm run test:go
pnpm run test:python
```

Per-package tests:

```bash
pnpm --dir apps/api test
pnpm --dir apps/cli test
go test ./services/sts/...
```

## Code Style

- File headers and naming conventions are enforced by the rules in `.claude/rules/` and `.github/instructions/`.
- One current implementation per feature — no fallback paths, no compatibility shims, no commented-out code.
- Don't add abstractions, helpers, or features beyond what a change requires.
- Match the surrounding code's level of abstraction and naming style.

## Submitting Changes

1. Create a topic branch off `main`.
2. Make focused commits; keep unrelated cleanups separate.
3. Run `pnpm test` and confirm `pnpm caracal up && pnpm caracal init && pnpm caracal run -- printenv RESOURCE_TOKEN` still succeeds end-to-end if your change touches the API, STS, or CLI.
4. Open a pull request describing the change, the affected directories, and any new instructions added.
5. Sign off with `git commit -s` if your change requires DCO.

## Security

Do not file public issues for vulnerabilities. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the disclosure process.

## Releasing

Releases are fully automated by [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml). To cut a release:

1. Confirm `main` is green.
2. Tag with semantic version: `git tag -a v0.1.1 -m "v0.1.1" && git push origin v0.1.1`.
3. The workflow runs `pnpm test`, then in parallel:
   - Stamps `apps/cli/src/runtime/version.ts` and `apps/cli/package.json` with the tag, regenerates `src/runtime/embedded.ts` via the `prebuild` hook, and builds five CLI binaries with `bun build --compile` (linux/darwin × x64/arm64 and windows-x64).
   - Builds and pushes five multi-arch (linux/amd64, linux/arm64) container images to GHCR with provenance + SBOM: `ghcr.io/garudex-labs/caracal-{api,sts,gateway,audit,coordinator}` tagged `vX.Y.Z`, `vX.Y`, and `latest`.
4. A GitHub Release is created with auto-generated notes and attaches every binary, `SHA256SUMS`, `install.sh`, and `install.ps1`.

End users install via `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Garudex-Labs/caracal/main/install.sh | sh`. Pin a version with `CARACAL_VERSION=v0.1.1` before the pipe.

Versioning policy: semver. Bump major on breaking CLI flags, API contracts, or compose service interfaces; minor for additive features; patch for bug fixes.

To preview the bundled runtime assets locally without releasing: `pnpm --dir apps/cli sync-embedded`.
